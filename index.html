        Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that
        rock’s perspective on Mars or that gaz opinion from Jupiter, nothing
        cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s
        no such thing as an issue. Down here, the only reality is the one inside
        our brain. Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it. Nothing exists
        neither if our senses don’t transmit the message. That means that if we
        mis sense, our reality changes. That’s possible because our perception
        is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example. If we mis
        translate the message, our reality changes. If we think it in a way, our
        reality changes depending on that way. Therefore, if we can change
        reality that much, everything’s fake. They’re proofs to that. Fall in
        love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine. Pull yourself
        out of that grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground,
        revealing him or herself differently. But the person is the same, you
        just changed your mind. Everything works like that : it’s not just that
        you can make your world, it’s that you passively do it anyway.

        <p>
          Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That
          evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,
          <q class="villagers">
            We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
            unfortunate.
          </q>
          The farmer said,
          <q class="farmer">
            Is it <strong class="good">good</strong>? Is it
            <strong class="bad">bad</strong>? I don't know.
          </q>
          The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,
          and in the evening everybody came back and said,
          <q class="villagers">
            Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have
            eight horses!
          </q>
          The farmer again said,
          <q class="farmer">
            Is it <strong class="good">good</strong>? Is it
            <strong class="bad">bad</strong>? I don't know.
          </q>
          The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while
          riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,
          <q class="villagers">
            Oh dear, that’s too <strong class="bad">bad</strong>,
          </q>
          and the farmer responded,
          <q class="farmer">
            Is it <strong class="good">good</strong>? Is it
            <strong class="bad">bad</strong>? I don't know.
          </q>
          The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people
          into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
          Again all the neighbors came around and said,
          <q class="villagers"> Isn’t that great! </q> Again, he said,
          <q class="farmer">
            Is it <strong class="good">good</strong>? Is it
            <strong class="bad">bad</strong>? I don't know.
          </q>
          The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense
          complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that
          happens in it is <strong class="good">good</strong> or
          <strong class="bad">bad</strong> — because you never know what will be
          the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the
          consequences of <strong class="good">good</strong> fortune.

      <strong class="good">Good</strong> and
      <strong class="bad">bad</strong> are just one perspective. Bananas are
      <strong class="good">good</strong> for monkeys, but monkeys are not
      <strong class="good">good</strong> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal
      out of it...
